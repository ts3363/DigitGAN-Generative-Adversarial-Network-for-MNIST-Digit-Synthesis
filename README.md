# Anime Face Generator using GANs with Reinforcement Learning

DigitGAN is a simple but powerful implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to synthesize realistic images similar to those in the Anime dataset. The project is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, making it easy to understand and modify.

## 📌 Features

- Uses the Anime dataset 
- Custom generator and discriminator models
- Adversarial training loop from scratch
- Generates and visualizes digit images at each epoch
- Lightweight and easy to run on CPUs or GPUs

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ganv4.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with the full implementation, training loop, and output visualization
- `images/` — Folder to store generated digit images (if implemented in code)

## 🧠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
